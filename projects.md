**Funding agency: National Science Foundation (NSF), Grant: CPS 2212582**

-	Investigate the coordination of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and intelligent human vehicles (IHVs) in a connected environment
-	Model the motion of the IHVs considering various uncertainties of the human behavior
-	Optimize control inputs for the AVs and advisory directives for the drivers on the IHVs to coordinate their motions
-	Leverage machine learning approaches and distributed optimization to reduce the computational time of the optimization.

## Motion Equations for the Ball and Beam and the Ball and Arc Systems (_2019_)
-	Identified that the conventional models consider the ball as a point mass which disregards the kinematics of the ball
-	Modeled the ball and beam and the ball and arc system considering the ball kinematics
-	Introduced dimensionless quantities to the dynamic equations of both systems rendering them in dimensionless form
-	Conducted comparisons between different ball and beam models with this new modified model

## Under actuated system modeling and nonlinear controller design (_2018_)
-	Applied Direct Lyapunov Approach, an energy-based nonlinear control approach on underactuated mechanical systems
-	Determined the control law that will stabilize the nonlinear system by solving for the potential from the dynamic PDE
-	Implemented the control law and investigated the response of systems using MATLAB and Simulink simulation

## Controlling an Inverted pendulum cart (_2018_)
-	Modeled the inverted pendulum cart system and derived its dynamic equations
-	Constructed the simulation of the inverted pendulum cart in MATLAB to study its behavior with different controllers
-	Using the linearized dynamic equations, designed LQR controller to stabilize the position of the inverted pendulum
-	Imported the designed controller in LabVIEW and implemented it to the inverted pendulum cart
-	Studied the performance of the designed controller and improved the controller to make the system more robust under disturbances

## Maze-solving robot with return algorithm (_2018_)
-	Soldered a row of 5 IR sensors to the robot so that it can identify and follow a line
-	Designed a PID controller to ensure robust line following and smooth high-speed turning without deviating from the path 
-	Implemented the left-hand algorithm for maze solving in the STM32 microcontroller of the robot using C++ programming 
-	Developed a return path algorithm so that the robot can return to its original position after solving the maze

## Controlling a brushed motor with flywheel attachment	(_2018_)
-	Modeled a brushed motor and derived its dynamic equations
-	Simulated the brushed motor in MATLAB and designed PID controller to control the speed and position of the brushed motor 
-	Imported the designed controller to LabVIEW and implemented it to the actual system
-	Studied the performance of our designed controller and improved the controller to meet the design constraints

## Gesture-controlled robotic lifter (_2014_) 
-	Designed a mechanism for the lifter so that it can operate smoothly with minimum actuator input
-	Designed the circuit model and connected the circuitry with the sensor and the actuator
-	Programmed the microcontroller so that it can understand predefined gesture patterns and give a command to the lifter accordingly
-	Tested the performance under varying operating conditions to make the system more accurate and efficient
-	Participated in three project competitions to showcase the project and won best project awards
